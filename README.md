# Hammurabi 
A way to a  small strategy game

Hello world,

I want to set up a server, that has a webfrontend, access to a database and some logic. In my case it is a simple "Hammurabi"-game, which everyone can play. Maybe in the future it gets some features, where the player get some advantages, when she does something in the "[hive](https://peakd.com)" world, i.e. some advertising. And in the long run I maybe want to benefit the player with some token. But that is far in the future.
